"""Compare a criterion run against a recorded baseline.

Usage:
    ./scripts/compare-bench.py <baseline.json> [criterion-dir]

`criterion-dir` defaults to `target/criterion`.

Numbers come from criterion's own machine-readable output —
`<criterion-dir>/<group>/<id>/new/estimates.json` — never from scraped
stdout. The human-readable `time: [a b c]` line is a rendering whose
format has changed between criterion releases, and the previous regex
(`^([\\w/]+)$` to find the bench name) silently matched nothing on some
runs, which is how a compare could report "0 entries" and still exit 0.
Reading the JSON makes an empty result a hard error instead.

The baseline is a JSON file with the shape:

    {
      "version": 2,
      "captured_at": "2026-09-27",
      "commit": "<git sha>",
      "benches": {
        "<group>/<id>": {
          "median_ns": <float>,
          "median_abs_dev_ns": <float>
        },
        ...
      }
    }

`median_ns` is criterion's median point estimate in nanoseconds.
`median_abs_dev_ns` is the median absolute deviation — a cheap, robust
read on how noisy that one measurement was, which is the difference
between "this got 6% slower" and "this runner was busy".

Exit codes:
    0 — no T1 bench past the GATE_PCT catastrophe line. Deltas past the
        5% advisory line are printed and counted, but do not fail.
    1 — a T1 bench regressed past GATE_PCT (i.e. got twice as slow).
        This is the only verdict that fails the build, and it is
        deliberately coarse: two `ubuntu-latest` runs of identical code
        differ by a median of 9.8% here, so a 5% gate would false-fail
        the majority of the suite every run. See GATE_PCT.
    2 — baseline missing, criterion dir missing, or zero entries found

# The advisory line: a delta past this is worth a human looking, and is
# printed in bold terms, but does not fail the build on its own.
ADVISORY_PCT = 5.0

# The only line that fails the build: a T1 bench that got twice as slow.
#
# A doubling is not a performance target. It is roughly the ceiling of
# what GitHub-hosted runners can distinguish, and it is here because
# the alternative is a gate that lies.
#
# Two `ubuntu-latest` runs of byte-identical code, captured back to back
# with no commit in between, differed by a median of 9.8% across the 73
# T1 benches, with a p90 of 63.0% and a worst case of +94.5%. 42 of
# them moved more than 5%. A 5% threshold therefore false-fails the
# majority of the suite on every run, which is not a gate, it is a coin
# flip with extra steps.
#
# The tell is uniformity rather than size: `letterbox/nearest_*` moved
# +63.0% to +63.4% across nine different resolutions. No code change
# produces identical percentages at every size; a different host CPU
# does. `letterbox/linear_*`, on the same runner, agreed to within 1%.
#
# So the split is deliberate:
#   - under ADVISORY_PCT       -> `ok`
#   - over ADVISORY_PCT        -> `ADVISORY` (loud, non-blocking)
#   - at or over GATE_PCT      -> `REGRESSION` (build fails)
#
# What this still catches is the class of change that matters at this
# stage of the project: a T1 path accidentally made quadratic, a cache
# that stopped hitting, a SIMD fast path that silently fell back to
# scalar. Those are 2x-and-up changes, and a doubling threshold will
# not hide them.
#
# Caveat, stated because it bounds how much this is worth: this is
# calibrated on one pair of runs. The number is the right order of
# magnitude, not a measured distribution. Tightening it needs a
# self-hosted, pinned-hardware runner, and until one exists a tighter
# figure here would be a claim the hardware cannot support.

# gated: a T1 target may run T2 benches as a side effect of being one
# crate's `[[bench]]` target, and §5 promises T2 is "benched on demand,
# not gated". Gating them anyway would make the rule a lie in the
# direction that costs the most CI time.

# `0.00 -> 0.00 us (+26.7%)` and failed the build on it -- a median of
# 0.5ns is a fraction of a single tick, so that "+26.7%" is a different
# rounding of zero, not a slowdown, and it can only ever produce false
# failures.

# floor would have silently un-gated roughly fifteen of them, which are

# no-ops (0.5ns, 0.7ns, 2.1ns) from the merely quick without exempting a
# single real measurement.
